A beneficial use of this function is a DELTA List containing many elements
that has failed. Instead of creating another DELTA List that contains     
corrections for the failed element(s) from the previous DELTA List, simply
correct the error(s) in the original DELTA List, Mark only those elements 
which require execution, and select the 'Execute Marked elements only'    
option at DELTA List execution.
