A Coordinated request is one in which the DELTA List is executed on all   
IMS systems in a user-defined Group. The DELTA List must complete         
successfully on ALL of the IMS systems or it will not be completed on any 
of the systems.

For example, a BMC AMI Change Manager for IMS TM defined Group of IMS systems named 'TEST'       
consists of IMS systems IMSA, IMSB and IMSC. A DELTA List is executed     
against 'TEST', and the Coordinate option is selected.  The DELTA List    
elements are successfully processed on IMSA and IMSB, but IMSC encounters 
an error. Changes are backed out on IMSA and IMSB, and results are        
reported for all three IMS's detailing the error(s).
