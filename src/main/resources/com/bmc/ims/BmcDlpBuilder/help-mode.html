Option 'Optimize execution', instructs DELTA PLUS to attempt execution of the ENTIRE DELTA List as a single unit-of-work in IMS. 
This is the recommended mode due to the speed in which the request is executed.      

<p>                                                                         
<b>Note:</b> You must select this option for a DELTA List that is defined as    
Dependent to execute in the fashion Dependent implies.</p>

 <p>                                                                 
Option 'One element at a time', instructs BMC AMI Change Manager for IMS TM to execute the DELTA
List sequentially, one element at a time. This mode is much slower than  
Optimize execution mode. However, there are certain occasions when one   
element at a time is desirable.                                          
For example, transactions T1, T2 and T3 all require the MAXRGN parameter 
be changed from 3 to 4. Since they must be stopped before they can be    
revised, you want them stopped for the shortest amount of time possible. 
With Optimized mode, ALL the /STOP commands are done BEFORE the DELTA    
revise is done, and ALL the /START commands are done AFTER the revise is 
done. Using 'One element at a time' mode, the /STOP is done for T1, T1 is
revised, then the /START command for T1 is issued before any activity  
takes place for T2 or T3.

This mode contains suboption Pause after elements with errors which    
instructs BMC AMI Change Manager for IMS TM to stop the DELTA List execution when an error is 
encountered. For additional information on the Pause option, place the 
cursor on the phrase highlighted above, and press HELP (F1).
