<p>Frequently, users request a group of changes that need to be made to the   
IMS system for a given application change or for a new release of the      
application. It is important that all of the changes be applied; if ALL of 
them cannot be made successfully, then NONE of the changes should be made. 
DELTA PLUS supports this requirement with the concept of dependent         
changes. Changes are grouped together in a single DELTA List that is       
designated as a dependent DELTA List. This designation ensures that all    
the changes in the DELTA List are successful or the changes will not be    
performed.                                                                 
</p>                                                                           
<p><b>NOTE:</b> When the dependent option is selected for a DELTA List that contains 
a COMMAND element, the success or failure of the COMMAND does not affect   
execution of the DELTA List.

 <p>                                                                          
For example, a dependent DELTA List contains multiple Revises and Adds for 
transactions and programs. The DELTA List also contains a COMMAND element  
that issues an invalid IMS command. At execution, the COMMAND element will 
be flagged as being in error, but the rest of the DELTA List will execute.
